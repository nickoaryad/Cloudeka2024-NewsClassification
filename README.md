# Cloudeka2024-NewsClassification

Welcome to the README of **Machine Learning: Developing NLP Model Using TensorFLow**. 

## The Dataset 📈
This repository uses dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hgultekin/bbcnewsarchive/data). 

## The Devs ✒️
This repository is developed as Final Assignment of **Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning** module, a part of **Machine Learning** learning path of **Dicoding** awarded by **Lintasarta Cloudeka Digischool 2024**. 

## The Problems 📝
This repository is focusing on these following bulletpoints:
* Minimum 1,000 samples for dataset
* Data split : 80% train and 20% validation
* Developing sequential model
* Commencing LSTM model within the model architecture
* Utilizing Embedding and Tokenizer function
* Training duration not more than 30 minutes
* 75% of minimum accuracy both train set and validation set

## The Libraries 📚
* `numpy` library to carry out numerical computation such as sets, arrays, multidimension matrixes, and vectors
* `pandas` library to undergo data processing, analysing, and manipulation using dataframe
* `matplotlib` library to perform visualization using plotting
* `os` library to execute loading data
* `zipfile` library to extract file
* `skicit learn` library to split dataset
* `tensorflow` library to generate image
* `keras` library to display image
* `nltk` library to commence text preprocessing
